  <p>Lowick Compost Site is situated between Lowick and Aldwincle, 2 minutes from the A6116 and 5 minutes from J12 of the A14. Use NN14 3EN and look out for the sign on the bend.</p>

  <p>The site is licensed by the Environment Agency and has PAS100 accreditation. The compost we produce is used on our own farm to improve soils and provide crop nutrients. We therefore take great care how we process our green waste.</p>
  
  <p>We accept green waste from small landscapers but also have a number of larger municipal contracts.</p>
